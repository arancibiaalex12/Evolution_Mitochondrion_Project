# A Simple Syntropic  Model for The Origin of Mitochondria 

The simulation code is an individual-based model,   
the spatial game, that approaches the ecological factors ( types of relationships ) that contribute to the early formation of the cooperative group after would give rise to endosymbiotic organisms with mitochondrion, the earliest stage of eukaryotic evolution.
